# Google Indexing Script

Use this script to get your entire site indexed on Google in less than 48 hours. No tricks, no hacks, just a simple script and a Google API.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> 1. This script uses [Google Indexing API](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/quickstart) and it only works on pages with either `JobPosting` or `BroadcastEvent` structured data.
> 2. Indexing != Ranking. This will not help your page rank on Google, it'll just let Google know about the existence of your pages.

## Requirements

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- An account on [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) with the verified sites you want to index
- An account on [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

## Preparation

1. Follow this [guide](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/prereqs) from Google. By the end of it, you should have a project on Google Cloud with the Indexing API enabled, a service account with the `Owner` permission on your sites.
2. Make sure you enable both [`Google Search Console API`](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/searchconsole.googleapis.com) and [`Web Search Indexing API`](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/indexing.googleapis.com) on your [Google Project âž¤ API Services âž¤ Enabled API & Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).
3. [Download the JSON](https://github.com/goenning/google-indexing-script/issues/2) file with the credentials of your service account and save it in the same folder as the script. The file should be named `service_account.json`

## Installation

### Using CLI

Install the cli globally on your machine.

```bash
npm i -g google-indexing-script
```

### Using the repository

Clone the repository to your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/goenning/google-indexing-script.git
cd google-indexing-script
```

Install and build the project.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm i -g .
```

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure you are using an up-to-date Node.js version, with a preference for v20 or later. Check your current version with `node -v`.

## Usage

<details open>
<summary>With <code>service_account.json</code> <i>(recommended)</i></summary>

Create a `.gis` directory in your home folder and move the `service_account.json` file there.

```bash
mkdir ~/.gis
mv service_account.json ~/.gis
```

Run the script with the domain or url you want to index.

```bash
gis <domain or url>
# example
gis seogets.com
```

Here are some other ways to run the script:

```bash
# custom path to service_account.json
gis seogets.com --path /path/to/service_account.json
# long version command
google-indexing-script seogets.com
# cloned repository
npm run index seogets.com
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>With environment variables</summary>

Open `service_account.json` and copy the `client_email` and `private_key` values.

Run the script with the domain or url you want to index.

```bash
GIS_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-client-email GIS_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key gis seogets.com
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>With arguments <i>(not recommended)</i></summary>

Open `service_account.json` and copy the `client_email` and `private_key` values.

Once you have the values, run the script with the domain or url you want to index, the client email and the private key.

```bash
gis seogets.com --client-email your-client-email --private-key your-private-key
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>As a npm module</summary>

You can also use the script as a [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-indexing-script) in your own project.

```bash
npm i google-indexing-script
```

```javascript
import { index } from "google-indexing-script";
import serviceAccount from "./service_account.json";

index("seogets.com", {
  client_email: serviceAccount.client_email,
  private_key: serviceAccount.private_key,
})
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
```

Read the [API documentation](https://jsdocs.io/package/google-indexing-script) for more details.

</details>

Here's an example of what you should expect:

![](./output.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Your site must have 1 or more sitemaps submitted to Google Search Console. Otherwise, the script will not be able to find the pages to index.
> - You can run the script as many times as you want. It will only index the pages that are not already indexed.
> - Sites with a large number of pages might take a while to index, be patient.

## Quota

Depending on your account several quotas are configured for the API (see [docs](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/quota-pricing#quota)). By default the script exits as soon as the rate limit is exceeded. You can configure a retry mechanism for the read requests that apply on a per minute time frame.

<details>
<summary>With environment variables</summary>

```bash
export GIS_QUOTA_RPM_RETRY=true
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>As a npm module</summary>

```javascript
import { index } from 'google-indexing-script'
import serviceAccount from './service_account.json'

index('seogets.com', {
  client_email: serviceAccount.client_email,
  private_key: serviceAccount.private_key
  quota: {
    rpmRetry: true
  }
})
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error)
```
